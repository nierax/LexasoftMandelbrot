#Calculation properties
calculation:
# Coordinates of the Mandelbrot set
# Hint: It is possible to omit either one dimension of the calculation or   
# of the image's width / height in order to get a 1:1 ratio between the 
# calculation of the image.

#Color defining porperties
color:
# Information about the colorization of the image.
# A color palette can consist of any number of colors, You like. 
# There are some predefined palettes:
# - BLACK_WHITE (Black for members of Mandelbrot set, white otherwise)
# - RAINBOW7 (7 Colors in the order of a rainbow)
# - RAINBOW29 (29 Colors in the order of a rainbow)
# - CUSTOM (Custom color palette - see example 2 for this)
  paletteVariant: "RAINBOW7"
# Expand the color palette to the given number of colors by calculating
# a color grading between the colors in the palette.
# In this example the 7 rainbow colors are extended with one more color 
# between every palette entry.
  colorGrading: 
    # LINE: Add transitions between each color, but not between the first and the last one.
    # To add a transition between the last and the first color use "CIRCLE" 
    style: LINE
    # The number is the total number of colors from the original palette and 
    # the intermediate steps.
    colorsTotal: 13 
# The color of the Mandelbrot set, default is black
